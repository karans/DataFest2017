#DataFest 2017

The data this year was part of an Expedia dataset. The code I worked on was joining the data files given, parsing, cleaning, and vectorizing the attributes to use in some test models. 

The ML models to predict bookings didn't perform well just using the attriutes given, so If we had more time, I would have developed custom features and used other techniques to work with imbalanced classes.
